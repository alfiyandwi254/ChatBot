This is some pict of my project build Chatbot with Copilot in Power Platform.

This pict show the flow of the Chatbot. The beginning is set the condition for user's input in chat Microsoft Teams and if the chat contain phrases that I've been set, it will trigger the Chatbot. 
Then it will show some options, Office's Operation and Microsoft365.
For now if user choose Office's Operation, it will direct to another topic, Operation.

Then it will show some options again and so on with the condition of the choosen options.
